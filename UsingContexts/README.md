# Use of Contexts

The Fn context stores configuration information about your functions and where your Docker images are stored. You can configure multiple contexts for your function development. For example, let's do the following:

* For local development, configure the Fn registry with an arbitrary value such as "fndemouser". This will save any docker images locally.
* For cloud development, configure a new Fn registry and store your images on Docker Hub.

## Before you Begin

* Set aside about 20 minutes to complete this tutorial.
* Make sure the Fn server is up and running in your computer, see [Install Fn](../install/README.md) for more details.
* Have your Docker Hub credentials handy.
* Have a second computer or virtual machine you can run Fn server on.

perform an action.

## Configure your Default Context
First, set up your default context [as described in the install tutorial](https://github.com/fnproject/tutorials/blob/master/install/README.md#configure-your-context).

To make sure your default Fn context is set correctly, list the contexts.

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn ls contexts
>```
```txt
CURRENT NAME    PROVIDER  API URL                REGISTRY
*       default default   http://localhost:8080  fndemouser
```

This shows that the default context is currently selected and the registry value is set to "fndemouser". Since `fndemouser` is just a string, your local Docker repository is used to store images.


## Create your Own Context
With the default context set, create your own context. To start with set the context for local development.

For example:

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn create context my-local-ctx --api-url http://localhost:8080 --registry fnlocal
>```
```txt
Successfully created context: my-local-ctx
```

The `fn create context` command creates a new context that can be used to deploy an application. This command has options to define the provider, api url and registry.

* --provider - You can define your own provider. In this example, notice that no provider was defined, then a default value is set.
* --api-url  - It is the api address and port where your application is deployed. It can be a local server, as in this example, or you can use a remote server.
* --registry - Name of your registry. For local development purposes you can define any name that makes sense to
 you. Also you can define your Docker Hub user name for a remote deploy.

For each context in your Fn CLI, you have a configuration file in a yaml format. You can find the context configuration files in the `~/.fn/context` directory.

Let's take a look to the `my-local-ctx.yaml` context file.

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> cat ~/.fn/contexts/my-local-ctx.yaml
>```
```txt
api-url: http://localhost:8080
provider: default
registry: fnlocal
```

Now let's take a look to the `default.yaml` context file.

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> cat ~/.fn/contexts/default.yaml
>```
```txt
api-url: http://localhost:8080
provider: default
registry: fndemouser
```

To create a new context, you can use the `fn create context` command or create a new configuration file using the yaml format in the `~/.fn/context` directory. Before you can use a context, it has to be specified as the default context.

Set `my-local-ctx` as the default context.

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn use context my-local-ctx
>```
```txt
Now using context: my-local-ctx
```

## Use Your Local Context

To use the `my-local-ctx` context, start by creating a Node.js function, then create the application it belongs to, and finally deploy the application in the `my-local-ctx` context.


### Create Your Function

First you need to create a simple `HelloWorld` function using `Node.js` as based language.

In a terminal type the following:

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn init --runtime node nodefn
>```
```txt
Creating function at: /nodefn
Function boilerplate generated.
func.yaml created.
```

A new directory is created for your function.

Go to your function directory.

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> cd nodefn
>```

Notice this directory has several files.
* func.js contains the generated Node function
* func.yaml is the function configuration file and lists its properties such as schema, name, version, runtime, and entrypoint.
* package.json specifies the Node.js dependecies required for this function.

### Create an Application
An application provides structure and organization for multiple functions. Before you deploy your function, it has to be part of an application.

To create an application, type the following:

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn create app nodeapp
>```
```txt
Successfully created app: nodeapp
```


### Deploy Your Function to a Local Server
Deploy your function to your local Fn server. This is helpfull when you want to test your function before deploying it in a cloud server.

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn deploy --app nodeapp --local
>```
```txt
Deploying nodefn to app: nodeapp
Bumped to version 0.0.2
Building image fnlocal/nodefn:0.0.2 ................................
Updating function nodefn using image fnlocal/nodefn:0.0.2...
Successfully created function: nodefn with fnlocal/nodefn:0.0.2
```

**Note:** Fn is based on Docker and when you first run the `fn start` command the Fn server docker image (fnproject/fnserver) is downloaded and started. When you run the deploy command, a new image is created to hold your funcion and it resides on your computer. In this case, the function was packaged in the `fnlocal/nodefn:0.0.2` image.

You may have a number of Docker images so use the following command to see only those created by `fnlocal`:

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> docker images | grep fnlocal
>```
```txt
REPOSITORY           TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
fnlocal/nodefn       0.0.2               b33abfd56e02        6 minutes ago       75.5MB
```

The Docker image resides only on your local machine. You cannot run it on a machine other than your own. If you want to make the Docker image available for other users, then you need to push it to a registry such as Docker Hub.

## Push Your Image to Docker Hub
A Docker registry is a system that stores Docker images. You can use Docker Hub to organize your Docker images into repositories. For example, a repository can have multiple versions of your image. By pushing your image to a Docker registry, you make your image public and accesible to other users and systems.

### Set Your Registry
To use Docker Hub as your registry, log in Docker using your user name and password. You can use the GUI on some operating systems, or the command line:

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> docker login
>```
```txt
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.
Username: <your-docker-username>
Password: <your-docker-password>
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /home/admin/.docker/config.json.
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store
```

Switch to your default context:

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn use context default
>```
```txt
Now using context:default
```

Update the registry value to your Docker account:

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn update context registry <your-docker-username>
>```
```txt
Current context updated registry with <your-docker-username>
```

### Deploy Your Application to a Remote Server

During deployment, Fn puts your function in the specified application. Then your function is packaged into an image and uploaded to Docker Hub. In the deploy command you can add the `--verbose` option to get more detail of what is happening with your function during deployment time.

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn --verbose deploy --app nodeapp
>```

Note that every time you redeploy, a new image and version are created. Since you defined your Docker Hub account in the registry property of the default context, this time the image is uploaded to Docker Hub.

## Use of an Existing Image

In case you want to distribute your image to other developers or if you want to use it in another machine, you can make use of the images deployed in Docker Hub. After you have your image in a Docker Hub registry, you can pull it to any machine. In this part, you deploy a function on a new machine using the image that you deployed and pushed to the Docker Hub registry before.

### Setup the New Machine

Before you begin make sure Fn server is up and running in the new machine, see [Install Fn](../install/README.md) for more details. Then copy the "my-local-ctx" yaml file from the old machine to the new machine. Remember you can find de context files in the "~/.fn/contexts/" directory. Finally, make sure you set the "my-local-ctx" context as default.

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn use context my-local-ctx
>```
```txt
Now using context: my-local-ctx
```

Also you have to create your application in the new machine.

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn create app nodeapp
>```
```txt
Successfully created app: nodeapp
```

### Invoke your Function

To invoke a function in the new machine from an existing Docker image, first log in to Docker Hub.

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> docker login
>```
```txt
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.
Username: <your-docker-username>
Password: <your-docker-password>
Login Succeeded
```

Then create a new function in the Fn server using the existing Docker image. Use the create command:
```txt
fn create function <app-name> <function-name> <your-docker-username>/<image-name>:<tag>
```
where:
* <app-name> is the application name that owns the function.
* <function-name> is the name of the function that Fn CLI creates.
* <your-docker-username> is your Docker Hub user name
* <image-name> is the name of the existing image in the Docker Hub
* <tag> is the version of your image

For example:

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn create function nodeapp nodefn <your-docker-username>:<tag>
>```
```txt
Successfully created function: nodefn with <your-docker-username>/nodefn:0.0.3
```

Finally, invoke your function

![user input](images/userinput.png)
>```
> fn invoke nodeapp nodefn
>```
```txt
{"message":"Hello World"}
```
